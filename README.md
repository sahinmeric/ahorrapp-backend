In this project I wanted to do on my own every part of our final project ([Ahorrapp](https://github.com/Matilop15/Ahorrapp)) of Holberton Schools Uruguay. The objective is to refactor and improve backend code, create a new frontend with Django MVT and deploy the project on AWS.  

### During this process I've learnt;  
 * Creating AWS EC2 Linux instance and configuring inbound & outbound security rules.
 * Configuring users, permissions and roles with AWS IAM. 
 * Connecting to instance with SSH and private key.  
 * Creating and activating a virtual environment for app.
 * Installing requirements of a project.  
 * Using VIM to edit files.  
 * Using environment variables.
 * Creating AWS RDS Postgres instance within same VPC with EC2 instance and configuring inbound & outbound security rules. 
 * Using Djangoâ€™s WSGIServer in Development.
 * Installing and configuring Gunicorn to replace WSGIServer of Django.
 * Installing and configuring Nginx to serve the app to the end users.
 * Configuring Nginx and Django to serve static files of the project.
 * Linking to a Domain.
 * Turning on HTTPS with SSL certificate.
 * Being patient xD
